Flame - Energy Visualisation Tool

Install Docker Compose at https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

To run server, use `docker-compose up` and go to localhost:8000

During development, run any `./manage.py` commands (e.g. `test` and `migrate`) by preceding them with `docker-compose run --rm flame` to run inside a container.
